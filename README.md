## Recent favourite project

I built a semantic document chunking system that uses embeddings to segment PDFs and lecture transcripts into coherent, context-preserving chunks. The system improves LLM retrieval and reasoning accuracy by avoiding naive length-based splits and maintaining semantic continuity. The final result contains the slide content, transcripts, and image-descriptions. Maxed out context!!
